## My process 
I built the skeletal part of the card on html and added flesh and styling with CSS and also made use of flex box for positioning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

 I learnt that simplicity in itself is complexity because using flexbox gave me a hard time.

### Continued development
Using more of flexbox 
css grids 
and more of semantic elements in my html codes



### Useful resources
